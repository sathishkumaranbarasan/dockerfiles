# Learn HTML in 12 Minutes

In this short HTML tutorial, I explain the basic structure of an HTML webpage and introduce some important tags.

# Getting started

This directory contains the source code from the tutorial. `webpage.html` is the source code from the video. `webpage-html5.html` is the same webpage but updated to follow HTML5 standards. Note the following differences:
- The file must start with the HTML5 doctype `<!DOCTYPE html>`,
- `<hr />`, `<br />`, and `<img /`> tags are no longer "self-closing" so do not include the forward slash `/`, and
- The `<img>` tag must include an `alt` attribute to specify alternative text if the image cannot be displayed.
